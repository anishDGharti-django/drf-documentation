"If you're doing REST-based web service stuff ... you should ignore request.POST."



Request parsing:
    "REST framework's Request objects provide flexible request parsing that allows you to treat requests with JSON data or other media types in the same way that you would normally deal with form data."


1:   .data
    request.data returns the parsed content of the request body. This is similar to the standard request.POST and request.FILES attributes except that:

    It includes all parsed content, including file and non-file inputs.
    It supports parsing the content of HTTP methods other than POST, meaning that you can access the content of PUT and PATCH requests.
    It supports REST framework's flexible request parsing, rather than just supporting form data. For example you can handle incoming JSON data similarly to how you handle incoming form data.
    For more details see the parsers documentation.
